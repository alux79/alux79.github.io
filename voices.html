        <h2>Interview</h2>
        <p>
          An informal interview with family members showed the important contrast between past experiences with education in Cambodia and modern approaches. This view gives a unique viewpoint, illustrating common perspectives that both parents and children had when interacting with Cambodian education, allowing for insight into more tensions between traditional values and modern reforms on a personal level.

        <h2>Differences & Integration</h2>
        <p>
          These experiences show that Cambodian education was built on respect, responsibility, and a commitment to learning and family. Although many methods used to enforce these values, such as corporal punishment, are without question, considered harmful in today’s world, the core ideas driving those methods still provide important lessons. Respect for teachers, commitment to education, a sense of community, and many more ideas were not just encouraged, but expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as the Cambodian education system moves towards modern reforms, there is a very real risk of losing these foundations. New methods and freedoms do bring many benefits, but occasionally do so without careful thought. They may leave a void that discipline, respect and purpose had filled. Berkvens (2017) mentions that reforms that ignore cultural and traditional values often have struggled to fully succeed. We come back to the idea that the real question is how can we integrate the best parts of traditional values into modernized systems.
