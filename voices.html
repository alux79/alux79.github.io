        <h2>Experiences</h2>
        <p>
          Growing up, I heard bits and pieces about what school was like for my parents in Cambodia. But sitting down and asking them directly made it clear how different their experiences were from mine, not just in setting or resources, but in values, expectations, and discipline. Their stories made me think more deeply about what Cambodian education has held onto, what it’s lost, and what it should still protect.</p>

            <li>“Now kids have more freedom, but sometimes they forget to respect.”</li>

        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          These comments from my parents remind us of the values that crafted a generation. Many of these experiences feel harsh, especially with the strict discipline and punishment, but the main thing that my parents were saying wasn’t just about control, it was about respect, responsibility, and knowing their importance towards education.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was listening to my parents, it was clear how much focus was used to be put on structure and stability. For students, there was a clear sense of respect for elders, for teachers, and for the process of learning itself. These ideas had given education a moral foundation that I believe we risk losing in modern education systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I say all of this, I can’t ignore what came with these traditional values. Fear of punishment, lack of voice, and emotional stress. Some methods and values, especially corporal punishment or total obedience cannot be justified just because they supposedly worked in the past. Some things need to be left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this definitely doesn’t mean everything should be scrapped. I believe that Cambodian education has an opportunity to not just modernize, but refocus their old ways and traditional values. What if we kept the respect but removed the fear? What if we valued discipline, but used it to support student well being rather than suppress it? Traditions don’t have to disappear, they can evolve.
