        <h2>Reflection from My Family</h2>
        <p>
          My parents’ experiences in school were shaped by strict authority and discipline, where respect for teachers was paramount, and questioning was seen as a challenge to that respect. They shared a sense of pride in the structure it provided, believing it helped foster responsibility and respect. However, they also acknowledged that the rigidity of such methods sometimes limited their ability to think independently and creatively.

        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at my parents’ reflections, I see how traditional values of respect, discipline, and hierarchy helped create a stable and predictable learning environment in the past. However, there are aspects of this structure that no longer serve the needs of a rapidly changing world. While their emphasis on respect and responsibility is valuable, I recognize that there is a need to move away from strict obedience and allow for more critical thinking and creative exploration. To move forward, a balance must be struck: maintaining the core values of respect and responsibility while also embracing the modern ideals of inquiry and personal expression.
