        <h2>Contrasting Ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Cambodia’s education system is constantly modernizing through new teaching strategies, curriculum updates, international influence, and expanding access to technology. These changes are meant to prepare students for a globalized, fast moving world. But as schools shift toward modern methods, they also begin to drift further from long standing cultural values. In many cases, the core beliefs behind traditional and modern education are not just different, but they pull in opposite directions. This growing tension raises tough questions about how far reform can go before something is left behind.

        <h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>
          If the values of modern education so often clash with traditional ones, then what happens next? As Cambodia continues to modernize, it arrives at an intersection of change. Will traditional values still have a place in classrooms shaped by critical thinking, student voice, and rapid technological change? Or will they slowly fade, seen as incompatible with progress?
