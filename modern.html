        <h2>Contrasting Ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Cambodia’s education system is quickly modernizing through new teaching strategies, curriculum reforms, international influences, and increased access to improving technology. Through these changes, Cambodia attempts to be seen in the scope of the world. Heng and Koemhong (2022) highlight that the modernization of education is imperative for Cambodia’s competitiveness in the world emphasizing that reforms should focus on values like critical thinking and innovation. These however, greatly contrast traditional Cambodian values and often inhibit things like character and morality (Chaika 2021). This then brings the question, how far do these reforms need to go before we lose something greater?

        <h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>
          The tension between modern and traditional educational values create a complex scene. Modern systems, as Heng and Koemhong (2022) and Sen (2022) argue, very clearly provide students with vital skills such as critical thinking, individual expression, and innovation that are truly important in the modernizing world, yet these ideas undermine traditional Cambodian values, potentially weakening ideas of social cohesion, discipline, and respect (Purwaningsih & Ridha, 2024). Furthermore, traditional values still are an important aspect of growing community, stability, and a strong identity. This results in a difficult question. If modern reforms directly contrast with traditional values, how is it possible to evolve the educational system without losing important cultural elements, while also using the beneficial parts of traditional values?
