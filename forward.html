          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            As the world keeps spinning, Cambodia will continue to modernize, and its education system will be influenced by how well it can balance tradition and modernization. With what we know, it is clear that traditional values like collectivism, stability, and respect have long fostered the character and integrity of students. But modern reforms will often conflict with these ideals (Berkvens, 2017; Heng & Koemhong, 2022; Chaika, 2021).
          </p><p>
            The main question was never simply whether traditional values belong in Cambodian education, but rather “How can traditional values be meaningfully adapted into a modern educational system.”

          <p>  
            From looking at the perspectives of Purwaningsih and Ridha (2024), we saw that traditional values shouldn’t be labeled as just outdated. When handled well, many common values can and will empower modern education, providing them with a moral and emotional foundation to learn effectively. Chaika (2021) also suggests that blending both ideals together instead of ignoring or replacing traditional values will lead to a more whole education system.
          </p><p>  
            Despite all this, it’s no question that ignoring the potential harm of traditional values would be arguably worse than not blending the systems. Sen (2022) states that blind trust in traditions like obedience and hierarchy can slow and ruin reform and important skills for students. If not handled carefully, there’s a great chance that the coming generations will not be prepared for the needs of a modernizing world.

      <h2>Suggested Paths Forward</h2>
      <div class="accordion-item open">
        <button class="accordion-toggle">Selective Preservation, Not Blind Tradition</button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="max-height: 500px; padding: 1em 2em;">
          <p>Schools should preserve traditional values that support student growth, such as maintaining a respect for educators and a sense of responsibility within a community. Schools also must reevaluate practices that hinder or harm individual thought or a student's well-being.</p>

      <div class="accordion-item open">
        <button class="accordion-toggle">Teacher Empowerment</button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="max-height: 500px; padding: 1em 2em;">
          <p>Teachers need to be at the front of any reform. Raising salaries, improving training, and giving the profession more respect is imperative to successfully blend tradition and modernity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>   
      <div class="accordion-item open">
        <button class="accordion-toggle">Respect Redefined</button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="max-height: 500px; padding: 1em 2em;">
          <p>Respect is without a doubt important, but it needs to be viewed through a different lens. Rather than blind obedience and silence, respect needs to be taught through active listening and thoughtful questioning.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="accordion-item open">
        <button class="accordion-toggle">Modern Methods, Traditional Foundations</button>
        <div class="accordion-content" style="max-height: 500px; padding: 1em 2em;">
          <p>New teaching strategies like question-based learning and student-centered classrooms shouldn’t be seen as offensive to Cambodian culture. Instead, they should be adapted to foster ideas of cooperation, trust, and perseverance, but in a way that supports critical thinking and self-empowerment.</p>

        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
          When looking ahead, Cambodia will face many opportunities and risks. The rapid modernization of the world will bring access to technology and methods of thinking that are unfathomable. Reform should not be allowed to be careless, if so, there is a great risk of losing both important and helpful aspects of culture and tradition. The best path for the future goes towards carefully integrating both tradition and modernity, and therefore creating an education system that prepares students for the world. The goal isn’t to choose tradition or modernity, it is to create something new that makes room for both.
