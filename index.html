        Is there still a place for traditional values within Cambodiaâ€™s education system in today's modernizing world? As standards are constantly changing in education, many countries need to adapt in order to keep up, Cambodia is no exception. Though many times along with adaptation, we lose tradition. Traditional values like authority, discipline, and collectivism have influenced how students are taught, how they learn, and how they accept information. However, many modernized values directly conflict with these traditional values, and brings up the aforementioned question, is there still a meaningful place for traditional values in Cambodian education?
